                        Amir left, deeply moved by his encounter with Malik. He realized that true wealth was not just
                        in
                        gold and riches, but in the richness of experiences and the wisdom that one gained along the
                        way.
                        Inspired by Malik's words, Amir decided to sponsor a public space for storytelling and
                        gatherings,
                        where people could come together to share their experiences and learn from one another.

                        And so, the legacy of the poor wise beggar continued to enrich the lives of those who crossed
                        his
                        path. Malik, the storyteller, remained beneath his oak tree, his hat still collecting coins from
                        passersby who recognized the true treasure he offered – not in gold, but in the stories that
                        illuminated their hearts and minds.
